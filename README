You can run our program by running inpaint.m in folder from MATLAB. The program also takes care of all compilation issues, provided you have configured MEX in your MATLAB for C++ bindings. We have tested our code on a Ubuntu m/c with MEX configured to use a GCC compiler.

Using the gui is very straightforward and self-explanatory. You can find some example images to play with in the /data folder.

The output are stored in VRML (*.wrl) files. We have configured our VRML viewer to viw3dScene (http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php). We assume viw3dScene is installed and exists in the system $PATH.

You can use any other viewer also. The output reconstruction (*.wrl) file of the algorithm is stored in make3d/scratch folder.

Please see our project report to see all the references and open source codes, we have used for this system.
We make use of make3D code available here: http://make3d.cs.cornell.edu/code.html
We also make use of Criminisi's inpainting code written by Sooraj Bhat: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sooraj/inpainting/
