1. Create a ~/.netrc file:
machine code.google.com
login [gmail address]
password [google code password]

Your Google code password is at https://code.google.com/hosting/settings

2. Pull code:
git clone https://[your Google ID]@code.google.com/p/inpainting-3dmodel/ .

3. The code has two directories currently:
./criminisi_inpainting - Criminisi 2003~4 code for inpainting\obj filling
./make3d - saxena 2005~9 code for single image 3D reconstruction

I have tried to remove around 400Megs of data from these directories and shifted it to [dropbox]/CS7495_Proj1/Data. I have also created a gatech_data directory to hold any data we collect.


RULES OF THUMB: 
* Do not dumb data on the git repository - it will kill the space we have!
* most of the git stuff can be conveniently done through the "git gui" command.
* Maintain all data (like images we are using) on Dropbox.
